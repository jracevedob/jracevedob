# [Javier Acevedo](https://jracevedob.github.io) 

I am professional baseband system engineer in Dresden, Germany. I am mostly interested on designing and deploying 
versatile and agile state-of-the-art compute platforms for wireless communication systems. I am currently working on bringing hardware acceleration to the Radio Access Network (RAN), while integrating it with the Core Network. 

## Motto

It is better to die on your feet that live on your knees - Emiliano Zapata.

## Main functional motivation
Hardware-Software Co-Design of the entire product development life cycle for 5G's RAN and Core Network.


## Contact

You can contact me mainly via E-mail under the following [address](mailto:jracevedob@gmail.com) account.

## Current projects

In this moement, we are working on two different projects about wireless communications and genetics.
1. Hardware accelerated version of the Open RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC).
2. Hardware accelerated version of the training sequence for protein folding.  [ESM Meta](https://github.com/jracevedob/esm)

## Learning and traning
Currently, I am learning how to employ Svelt and Nx Monorepo to enhance frontend development. This is my first approach to frontend development.

## News
rApps: the Non Real Time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) represents a great opportunity for innovation in wireless communication networks.
I have had the pleasure to start working on the Open RAN Software Community with the target in mind of being able to develop rApps to control the whole RAN.

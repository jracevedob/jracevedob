# [Javier Acevedo](https://jracevedob.github.io) 

I am professional baseband system engineer in Dresden, Germany. I am mostly interested on designing and deploying 
versatile and agile state-of-the-art compute platforms for wireless communication systems. I am currently working on bringing hardware acceleration to the Radio Access Network (RAN), while integrating it with the Core Network. 

## Motto

It is better to die on your feet that live on your knees - Emiliano Zapata.

## Main functional motivation
Hardware-Software Co-Design of the entire product development life cycle for 5G's RAN and Core Network.

## Current projects

In this moement, we are working on three different projects ranging from wireless communications until power electroncis and genetics.
1. Hardware accelerated version of the Open RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC).
2. Hardware-in-the-Loop for power electronics application for DC-DC voltage control.
3. Hardware accelerated version of the training sequence for protein folding.

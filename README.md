# [Javier Acevedo](https://jracevedob.github.com) 

I am researcher and professional engineer in telecommunications in Dresden, Germany. 

Before joining  [Xilinx Inc.](https://www.xilinx.com/)


## Research Focus and Engineering Development

My academic and professional interest rely on the design and implementation of elegant hardware accelerators for the next generation of wireless communication systems. With the rise of the [Open-RAN](https://telecominfraproject.com/openran/) alliance, I am pretending to contibute in providing souveranity to Europe in the build and release of wireless communication systems applied eather in cellular and in private industrial networks.

Currently, my website is under development, but you will find all the important information there soon. Please stay tuned on: https://jracevedob.githu.io, including a list of [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vUwpfSsAAAAJ&hl=ro).

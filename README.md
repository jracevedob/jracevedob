# [Javier Acevedo](https://jracevedob.github.com) 

I am researcher and professional engineer in the fields of Telecommunications and Hardware Design in Dresden, Germany. 

Before joining  [Inc.](), I had the pleasure of being part of [Infineon](https://www.infineon.com/), [Fraunhofer Integrierte Schaltungen (IIS)](https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/), and [Michelin (Mefro Wheels) France](https://middle-east.michelin.com/en/). 


## Research Focus and Engineering Development

My academic and professional interest rely on the design and implementation of elegant hardware accelerators for the 5th and next generations of wireless communication systems. With the rise of the [Open-RAN](https://telecominfraproject.com/openran/) alliance, I am pretending to contibute in providing souveranity to Europe in the build and release of wireless communication systems applied eather in cellular and in private industrial networks. My work focuses on garanting ultra-low latency in the fronthaul of the 5G's RAN, which connects the RAN's Radio Unit (RU) with the signal processing Distributed Unit (DU).

Currently, my website is under development, but you will find all the important information there soon. Please stay tuned on the following links: https://jracevedob.github.io, including a list of [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vUwpfSsAAAAJ&hl=ro) and source code [repositories](https://github.com/jracevedob?tab=repositories).


## Interesting Links

In this section, you will find a set of project I am working on parallel to my work as an engineer. Those projets range from implementation of image detection and segmentation for ADAS to my work as a professional teacher for German, French, Spanish in cooperation with the Goethe Institut, Institut Francais and the Enkontext Group in Dresden.

[ADAS Development on Multi-Processor System-on-Chip](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsfqqaoYj76p6PLTg8Fztcw/videos) - Image segmentation and detection in a real car scene.

[Virtualization of USPR]() - Virtualization of USRP's hardware resources using hypervisor for the ARM architecture.

[Hardware Acceleration for Open RAN]() - Acceleration of signal processing baseband functions using Xilinx's MPSoC architecture.

[Deutsch Lehren Lernen bei Goethe Institut]() - DLL Program between Goethe Institut and the University of Kiel.

[Enkontext Gruppe]() - Democratization to the access language.
